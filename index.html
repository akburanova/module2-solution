	"What Hurts The Most"<br>
What hurts the most<br>
Was being so close<br>
And having so much to say<br>
And watching you walk away<br>
And never knowing<br>
What could have been<br>
And not seeing that loving you<br>
Is what I was tryin&#39; do<br>

	&#39;A Little Too Not Over You&#39;<br>
Oohhhh oh, oh..<br>It never crossed my mind at all.<br>It's what I tell myself.<br>What we had has come and gone.<br>
You're better off with someone else.<br>It's for the best, I know it is.<br>But I see you.<br>Sometimes I try to hide<br>
What I feel inside,<br>And I turn around.<br>You're with him now.<br>
I just can't figure it out.<br>Tell me why you're so hard to forget.<br>Don't remind me, I'm not over it.<br>Tell me why I can't seem to face the truth.<br>
I'm just a little too not over you.<br>Not over you....

	 Il Mondo<br>
Un mondo<br>
Soltanto adesso, io ti guardo<br>
Nel tuo silenzio io mi perdo<br>
E sono niente accanto a te<br>
Il mondo<br>
Non si é fermato mai un momento<br>
La notte insegue sempre il giorno<br>
Ed il giorno verrà<br>
